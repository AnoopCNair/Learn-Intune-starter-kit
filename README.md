Intune standalone starter kit. I think this post will help to start learning Intune from scratch. I won't cover SCCM Hybrid/Mixed Intune and Office 365 Intune MDM. In most of the scenarios (for Intune Standalone), no need/very minimal need for on-premises infrastructure.  Intune standalone is the way to go when you want to take the path of modern management.
